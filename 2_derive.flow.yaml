  # Membership is a mapping of (segment, user) => {segmentation status}.
  # The derivation is suited for materialization into sorted key/value stores

  # can be used to walk the full membership of a segment (even if very large).
  # As with the "pull" user profile, this derivation is stateless and produces
  # partial roll-ups of the current segmentation status for each composite key,
  # which is fully reduced only upon materialization into a store.
